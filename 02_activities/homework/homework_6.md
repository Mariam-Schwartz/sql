**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


In my previous work, I typically would focus more on my analytical approach, and whether or not I had the right logic, and then find the data set that would help me solve for an answer using the logic. I rarely considered the design thing and human centered approach to the solutions I was working on. 

I think moving forward, it is critical to incorporate elements of ethics and equity at the very beginning – considering questions like who am I excluding with the data set I have or the way I intend to capture data, and who, if anyone could my process, or analysis cause harm to. 

I would also place emphasis on creating systems that really protect people’s privacy, to eliminate the use of personally identifiable data and to curb potential biases in the system. This may look like not collecting certain data sets that could introduce bias, or anonymizing data before analysis to protect the identity of the people/ population that data represents. 

It won’t be an easy process; I think we have come to see data and analytics as this objective process and framework for decision making. However, as with all human systems, we cannot completely eliminate our influences, especially when we understand that the data sets we collect are basically a model of the biased, inequitable world we live in.
